//First lesson about C# in this course involved printing lines to the console

//Print the literal string "Hello World!" to the console
Console.Write("Hello World!");


Console.WriteLine("This is on one line.");
Console.Write("This is on another line");

//The difference between the Write and WriteLine methods is that WriteLine appends a newline to the end.
